# EXPERT SYSTEM

### *Aim*

To expand the boundaries of Machine Learning and free it from the constraints of programming languages and coding knowledge.

### *Abstract*

Machine Learning is a vast and complex field that requires a lot of dedication and time to master. 
It is a field where the knowledge of programming languages is essential to implement the algorithms and models. 
But what if we could remove this constraint and allow the users to build models without any coding knowledge? This is where Expert System comes into play. 

Expert System is a platform that allows users to build, train, and test Machine Learning models without the need for programming languages. 
It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their data, select the algorithm, and train the model with a click of a button. 
Expert System is designed to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone, regardless of their coding knowledge. 
It aims to democratize Machine Learning and make it easier for people to build and deploy models for their use cases. 
Expert System is built on the principles of simplicity, accessibility, and ease of use. 

With Expert System, Machine Learning is no longer limited to programmers and data scientists. 
It is open to everyone who wants to harness the power of data and build intelligent systems.

### *Development*:

#### 1. Basics
#### 2. Updation
#### 3. Final Stage


### *Technologies*:

1. *Django*: The web interface is built using Django, popular web framework.
3. *Scikit-learn*: Expert System leverages Scikit-learn, a popular Machine Learning library in Python, to implement the algorithms and models.
4. *Pandas*, *Numpy*: Powerful data manipulation libraries in Python, to handle the input data.
5. *Matplotlib*: A popular plotting library in Python, to visualize the data and results.
